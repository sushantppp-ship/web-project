      <h1>Site Report & Reflective Discussion</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This site report describes my experience of designing and developing a responsive
          portfolio website for the CSY1063 Web Development module. The purpose of the website
          is to present my profile, projects, contact details, video demonstration, and this
          reflective report using modern client-side web technologies such as HTML5 and CSS.
        </p>

        <h2>Development Process and Learning Experience</h2>
        <p>
          At the beginning of the module, I found web development challenging, especially
          understanding how different HTML elements work together and how CSS affects page
          layout. I initially relied too much on generic <code>div</code> elements, but as the
          module progressed, I learned the importance of using semantic HTML tags such as
          <code>header</code>, <code>nav</code>, <code>main</code>, <code>section</code>, and
          <code>footer</code> to improve structure and accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most difficult parts was working with CSS layouts. I faced issues with
          alignment, spacing, and responsive behaviour, particularly when switching between
          desktop and mobile views. Through experimentation, debugging, and use of browser
          developer tools, I learned how CSS Grid and Flexbox can be used together to create
          flexible and well-structured layouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Debugging was sometimes frustrating, especially when small errors such as incorrect
          file paths, missing closing tags, or CSS conflicts caused the layout to break.
          However, these challenges helped me build confidence and improved my ability to
          identify and fix problems independently.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Design Decisions and User Interface</h2>
        <p>
          The website was designed with a clean and simple user interface to ensure readability
          and ease of navigation. A consistent navigation menu is used across all pages so users
          can easily move between sections of the site. A red accent colour was chosen for
          buttons and highlights to create visual contrast while keeping the overall design
          professional.
        </p>
        <p>
          Responsive design was a key focus of this project. Media queries were used to adapt
          the layout for smaller screens, and a hamburger navigation menu was implemented so
          that the website remains usable on mobile devices. The Projects page uses a different
          grid layout from the other pages to demonstrate my understanding of layout variation
          using CSS Grid.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>Validation and Technical Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          All HTML and CSS files were tested using the W3C HTML and CSS validation tools to
          ensure compliance with web standards. Validation helped me identify and correct
          syntax errors and improve the overall quality of my code. Screenshots of the
          validation results are included below.

        <h2>Version Control and GitHub Usage</h2>
        <p>
          GitHub was used throughout the development of this project to manage version control.
          Regular commits were made on different dates with meaningful commit messages to
          document the progress of the website. This allowed me to track changes, experiment
          safely, and revert to earlier versions when necessary.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Use of Generative AI</h2>
        <p>
          Generative AI tools were used in an assistive role to help understand HTML and CSS
          concepts and to debug layout and responsiveness issues. All code was written, tested,
          and fully understood by me in accordance with the module’s academic integrity and
          Generative AI guidelines.
